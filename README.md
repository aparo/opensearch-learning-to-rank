# Important Notice

This is a fork of https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank to work with OpenSearch. It's a rewrite of some parts to be able to work with OpenSearch 1.x. Please refer to official documentation of [Elasticsearch Learning to Rank](http://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io) for usage.

The OpenSearch Learning to Rank plugin uses machine learning to improve search relevance ranking. The original Elasticsearch LTR plugin is powering search at places like Wikimedia Foundation and Snagajob!


# Installing

To install, you'd run a command like this but replacing with the appropriate prebuilt version zip:

| OS     | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| 1.0.0  | `bin/opensearch-plugin install https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-learning-to-rank/releases/download/1.0.0/ltr-1.5.4-os1.0.0.zip` |
| 1.1.0  | `bin/opensearch-plugin install https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-learning-to-rank/releases/download/1.1.0/ltr-1.5.4-os1.1.0.zip` |
| 1.2.0  | `bin/opensearch-plugin install https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-learning-to-rank/releases/download/1.2.0/ltr-1.5.4-os1.2.0.zip` |
| 1.2.2  | `bin/opensearch-plugin install https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-learning-to-rank/releases/download/1.2.2/ltr-1.5.4-os1.2.2.zip` |
| 1.2.3  | `bin/opensearch-plugin install https://github.com/aparo/opensearch-learning-to-rank/releases/download/1.2.3/ltr-1.5.4-os1.2.3.zip` |


(It's expected you'll confirm some security exceptions, you can pass `-b` to `opensearch-plugin` to automatically install)

If you already are running OpenSearch, don't forget to restart!


## About alpha releases

These releases are alpha because some issues with the tests due to securemock that depends on ElasticSearch security stuff.
